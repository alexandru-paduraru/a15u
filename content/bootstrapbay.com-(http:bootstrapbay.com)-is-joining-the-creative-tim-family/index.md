BootstrapBay.com (http://bootstrapbay.com/) is joining the Creative Tim family¬†

one of the biggest Marketplaces for Bootstrap is acquired by Creative Tim

---

  

1.  Why we wanted to acquired this marketplace

It all started 2 years ago, when our startup www.creative-tim.com (http://www.creative-tim.com/) was in the ‚Äúgenerate money but not enough to sustain a business‚Äù mode. We‚Äôve seen that there were a lot of people interested in our freebies but we hadn‚Äôt enough conversion on our single Premium Product GSD Kit PRO (http://gsdk.creative-tim.com/). If you want to check the whole story about how we started, please read this article (http://blog.creative-tim.com/creative-tim/started-0-starbucks-created-startup/). So, what do you do when you want to grow a business? You check around for bigger businesses where you can get inspiration. We knew Chris (https://twitter.com/cgimmer), the co-founder of BootstrapBay.com (http://bootstrapbay.com/) from Franco Varriano (https://twitter.com/FrancoVarriano). Franco also helped us in the beginning with a lot of Marketing and Growth tips which we used and then made the connection With Chris, back in November 2014.

  

\[Image: file:///-/blob/EIAAAATpFIr/tc3B77UBodNrw1dYKxLkfQ\]We‚Äôve always seen Chris as a cool guy and also a very motivational person for us, from which we can learn a lot. So in January 2015 we had our first interview with Chris, where he gave us some information about how he is growing his marketplace and what strategies he is using for the moment. The interview can be seen here: Working on the Best Bootstrap Resources (http://blog.creative-tim.com/web-development/working-best-bootstrap-resources/). We also wanted to transform creative-tim.com (http://creative-tim.com/) in a 2 sided Marketplace but we faced the Chicken/Egg problem: You need content to make visitors come to your website, but you need visitors to convince content creators to publish their work on your marketplace. So where are you starting? Chris had a great idea, he started to generate visits by writing great content on BootstrapBay‚Äôs blog, in this way he solved the visitors problem. In the meantime they also created the first 3 themes inside their team so they can have some content for those visitors. The whole story about how Chris created his marketplace to over $10.000 in monthly revenue can be found on his personal blog: How We Bootstrapped a Two-Sided Marketplace to $10k/mo in Revenue (http://chrisgimmer.com/two-sided-marketplace/).

  

  

2\. How this acquisition will help us deliver great products to a bigger audience of developers

  

Since the launch of creative-tim.com (http://creative-tim.com/) our mission was to help web developers create better websites with less effort. We always shared good looking and user friendly freebies UI kits and Dashboards that we‚Äôve created and used as the starting base for our web agency‚Äôs projects.¬†

  

We recently migrated some of our most popular freebies, which have over 200.000 downloads in total, to MIT License. Why are we giving under MIT License some products that took us hundred of hours and months of development and iterations? Because we want to help the developers community. Period. You can view, contribute, use them for commercial products and play with them on Creative Tim Official Github (https://github.com/creativetimofficial).

¬†We will migrate all of them soon. Back to BootstrapBay, it has 2x more traffic then Creative Tim, and over 80% of that traffic is going to Tutorials for web developers, that means there are a lot of people who want to learn and we will help them from the beginning of their journey. If we set for them high standards of design and quality, then, all their future work will be at least as good as our products.

So our mission will continue with this new acquisition.

  

3\. What will happen in future with the marketplace, its creators and its customers

  

As we said, we have a 2 sided market place. That means the creators are as important as the visitors/buyers, so we need to make something in order to make boths side happy to be on BootstrapBay. So, for the creators who want to achieve more (better products, more sales etc.) we are preparing some special accounts on creative-tim.com (http://creative-tim.com/) and they will:

  

-   have free access to resources that are valued at over $2.100. You can see them here: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/buy/bundle
-   \* be able to create the future products using our products as the base framework.
-   \* receive constant feedback from our specialized team in order to improve their work.¬†

For the visitors and buyers we are working on:¬†

  

-   a major redesign, which will make BootstrapBay more user friendly
-   \* a review system so they can view the quality of a template based on different criterias like code quality, design, support etc.
-   \* a comments system, where they will be able to talk directly with the creators and help each other
-   \* New Bootstrap 4 Templates and new creators

We are also going to invest a lot in Marketing and continue the creation of. Tutorials for web developers.

  

We are very happy with BootstrapBay joining our family. If you have any suggestions, we would be glad to talk in the comments.
